## Natural Selection Does Not Come Naturally: Getting mired in pattern & process and proximate & ultimate causality

Biology offers explanation at multiple levels: first by establishing patterns and investigating their causal processes, and then by providing proximate and ultimate causes for observed patterns and processes. This dual causality -- the proximate functional 'how' and the ultimate evolutionary 'why' -- is of particular importance to biological sciences; the 'why' being the stuff that gives the 'how' consequence. Yet hundreds of studies demonstrate that students hold tenacious misconceptions regarding the evolutionary principles necessary for recognizing levels of biological explanation, and that formal instruction does little to address such misconceptions. 

To explore how students construct their own explanations regarding the process of natural selection and the resultant patterns of adaptation -- and whether or not such explanations change following formal instruction -- I administered an assignment with five open-ended reflective questions both before and after instruction. The study spanned two semesters and included more than 600 student participants across four biology courses, from introductory to advanced, including both majors and non-majors. I find that irrespective of students' year of study, major, course affiliation, or number of previous credits in biology, more than 80 percent of study participants were unable to identify the ultimate (evolutionary) processes responsible for observed patterns of adaptation both before and after formal instruction. 

Dobzhansky famously said that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. As such, forming a robust conceptual framework in biology requires distinguishing patterns from the processes that generate them -- as well as distinguishing the functional and evolutionary explanations for such patterns and processes. Without these higher-order cognitive skills, students face an enormous challenge in their conceptual learning of evolution and of biology generally. Here I review the implications of these findings for the teaching and learning of biological sciences, and briefly touch on methods of explicitly addressing such cognitive skills in the classroom.
